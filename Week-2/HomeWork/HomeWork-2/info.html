        <h2>About J.K. Rowling</h2>
        <p>
            J.K. Rowling is the author of the Harry Potter series. Her full name is Joanne Rowling, and although she does not have a middle name, she adopted the name Kathleen in honor of her grandmother.
        </p>

        <h3>Life Before Harry Potter</h3>
        <p>
            'J.K. Rowling' was born on July 31, 1965, in Chipping Sodbury, England. She moved with her family to Bristol, then to Chepstow. She attended Wyedean Comprehensive School and studied French and classical literature at Exeter University, which included a year of study in France. Afterward, she moved to London to work as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International. She published her first work, a book titled "Rabbit," at the age of six. However, it was the Harry Potter series that changed her life.

        <p>
            The reason Joanne Rowling changed her name to Joanne Kathleen Rowling was due to the publisher "Bloomsbury's" fear that young boys would be reluctant to read a book written by a woman. To appeal to a wider audience, she used the pen name "J.K. Rowling." In her childhood, she was called "Jo" by everyone, and only one person called her "Joanne" when angry.

        <p>
            During this time, Rowling had an idea for a story about a boy attending a school for wizards. She focused on this idea during a four-hour delayed Manchester-London train journey. By the end of the trip, she had developed the basic storyline and characters for what would become "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone." Rowling began writing the story during her lunch breaks.

            She later moved to Portugal, where she taught English. On October 16, 1992, she married Portuguese TV journalist Jorge Arantes and gave birth to her first child, Jessica Rowling Arantes, on July 27, 1993. The couple divorced in 1995.

            In December 1994, Rowling moved to Edinburgh with her daughter to be closer to her sister. Living on welfare, Rowling completed her first book in what is now a Chinese restaurant called Nicolson's Caf√©. She also pursued a one-year postgraduate course at the University of Edinburgh, from which she graduated in 1996.

        <h3>Life After Harry Potter</h3>
        <p>
            Rowling's Harry Potter series sold over 400 million copies worldwide, making both the book and its author famous. The series captivated readers with its boundless imagination and quickly became a bestseller. Rowling earned over $1 billion from the books, becoming the first person to reach billionaire status by writing, and she was also crowned the richest woman in the UK.

            Along with her professional success, Rowling's personal life has flourished. On December 26, 2001, she married Neil Murray, a doctor, in a small ceremony at their home in Perthshire. On March 23, 2003, Rowling gave birth to her second child, David Gordon Rowling Murray, to whom she dedicated "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." On January 23, 2005, she fulfilled her dream of having three children when she gave birth to Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray.
